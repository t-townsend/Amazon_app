# Amazon Express

This is an app made in Ruby on Rails, and is meant to mimic an online
product website, such as Amazon. It allows the user to make a new product,
edit the product or delete it, and create reviews for the product. It also includes
an index and show page for each product. This project includes user authentication,
and the user, therefore, cannot add a post or review a post without being
signed in.

**Technologies Used: Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Postgres, SQL**
